## Description

Squeak is a recreation of the card game popularly known as ["Nerts"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerts) made with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). This project relies heavily on [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) to handle all realtime game logic and transmission. Authentication is handled by [Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) and the Postgres database is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/). 

Games can be played with 2-4 players and last roughly 20-40 minutes, depending on how many rounds there are. Sometime in the future I plan on creating native iOS and Android apps utilizing React Native with Expo.
